## What happens under the hood?
First time you run `gradlr` it will cache the gradle tasks so the #2 time it'll load them instantantly.
How does it know it needs to re-index? When caching, this tool saves a checksum of the sum of checksums of all of the projects' gradle files (META!), so it knows when you changed something and re-indexes when needed.

## Should I commit the `.tasks.cache.json` file?
If you commit it, your colleagues will not have to index the tasks again.

### What terminal am I using?
Since a lot of people has been asking about my terminal setup, I made [this article](https://medium.com/@cesarmcferreira/what-terminal-am-i-using-cesar-ferreira-2e19e5f58fc5) explaining how to achieve it.
